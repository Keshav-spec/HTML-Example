		<h1>The Beauty of Nature</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:20px;margin-left:40px;color:navy">Nature has always been a source of inspiration, solace, and awe. From the majestic mountains to the tranquil oceans, the beauty of the natural world provides a sense of wonder that <span class="edit-text">transcends</span> time and culture. Throughout history, humanity has been deeply connected to the land, the sky, and the elements, drawing strength and wisdom from the environment around them.</p>
		<h2>The Majestic Mountains</h2>
		<p id="para"> Mountains stand as towering sentinels, their peaks often hidden by clouds. The <span class="edit-text">snow-capped summits</span> glisten under the sun, while the valleys below are alive with a lush variety of plant and animal life. The mountains serve not only as geographical landmarks but also as symbols of resilience and endurance.</p>
